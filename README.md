# USB C to Ethernet Connector

The idea of this  project is simply using your usb-c cable (USB3 or Thunderbolt) as a Ethernet patch cord.
The PCB design include the pair of connectors attached to each end of the cable..


Here's the example pinout

USB Ethernet NIC #1
1 TX+ White Orange = B11
2 TX- Orange       = B10
3 RX+ White Green  = A11
6 RX- Green        = A10
5 B1+ White Blue   = A2
4 B1- Blue         = A3
7 B2+ White Brown  = B2
8 B2- Brown        = B3

USB Ethernet NIC #2
1 TX+ White Orange = A2
2 TX- Orange       = A3
3 RX+ White Green  = B2
6 RX- Green        = B3
5 B1+ White Blue   = B11
4 B1- Blue         = B10
7 B2+ White Brown  = A11
8 B2- Brown        = A10
